# Advanced Computer Vision - HW4: Template Matching & Feature Detection

## 📝 Introduction
This project focuses on object detection and recognition using **Template Matching** and **Feature-based Matching** (SIFT). The tasks involve solving digital jigsaw puzzles and detecting objects in real-world scenes with perspective distortion.

## 🛠️ Environment
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
- **Language:** C/C++
- **Library:** OpenCV (Requires `opencv_contrib` or OpenCV > 4.4.0 for SIFT)

## 📊 Results
- Successfully solved the multi-scale matching problem with high accuracy.
- The SIFT-based approach robustly detected the target object despite >45 degree rotation and perspective changes.
